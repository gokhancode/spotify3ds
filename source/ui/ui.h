/* Shared drawing helpers and the type scale.
 *
 * The mockup specifies type in CSS pixels. citro2d's text scale is a float
 * multiplier on the system font, so the mapping has to be derived from the
 * font's own metrics rather than guessed - and the system font differs by
 * region and firmware, so it cannot be hardcoded either. ui_init() reads
 * fontGetInfo() once and fills the table; ui_font_probe() reports the numbers
 * so the arithmetic is checkable in a transcript.
