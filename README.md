# Spotify3DS

A Spotify remote for the Nintendo 3DS / New 2DS XL.

- **Top screen:** album cover, artist, album/track name
- **Bottom screen (touch):** previous / play-pause / next, plus a seek scrubber
- **Library:** recently played collections, playlists, saved albums, and their
  individual tracks

Use the L/R shoulder buttons from any screen to decrease or increase active device's volume.

Audio keeps playing on your phone or desktop — this controls Spotify's
*active device* via the official Web API. It is a remote, not a player.

## Lyrics (this fork)

This fork adds **time-synced lyrics** on top of upstream
[avncharlie/spotify3ds](https://github.com/avncharlie/spotify3ds).

- Hold **L + R** and tap **Up** to open the lyrics view on the bottom screen. It
  auto-scrolls in time with the track; drag or use the D-pad to scroll by hand.
- Press **Y** (or tap the on-screen **3D** pill) to move the lyrics to the top
  screen as a hovering **3D** stack — the current line floats in front while the
  previous/next lines sit behind it. On a 3DS, push the depth slider up.
- **B** (or the same L+R+Up chord) closes the view.

Lyrics come from the open [lrclib.net](https://lrclib.net) API, since Spotify's
Web API exposes none; coverage depends on that database, and instrumental or
unmatched tracks say so. No extra setup — it reuses your existing `creds.cfg`.

## Installation

You need Spotify Premium, a homebrew-enabled 3DS, Python 3 on your computer,
and access to the console's SD card.

Download `Spotify3DS.cia` from the project's
[latest release](https://github.com/avncharlie/spotify3ds/releases/latest).
You can also scan this QR code in FBI under **Remote Install → Scan QR Code**
to install the latest CIA directly:

<a href="https://github.com/avncharlie/spotify3ds/releases/latest/download/Spotify3DS.cia"><img src="assets/latest-release-qr.png" alt="QR code for the latest Spotify3DS CIA" width="240"></a>

To update an existing installation, re-scan the same QR code in FBI. It always
points to the CIA from the latest release.

1. Create an app in the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
   Select **Web API**, add `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` as a redirect URI,
   and copy the app's Client ID. No client secret is needed.
2. From this project directory, generate your console credentials:

   ```sh
   python3 tools/bootstrap_auth.py --client-id <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
   ```

   Your browser will open Spotify's authorization page. After approval, the
   script writes `creds.cfg` in the project directory.
3. Create a folder named `spotify` at the root of the 3DS SD card and copy the
   generated file to it. The resulting path must be `/spotify/creds.cfg`.
4. Copy `Spotify3DS.cia` to the SD card, put the card back in the console, and
   install the CIA with FBI or another homebrew CIA installer (Or install via
   QR code)

Start playback on a Spotify device before opening Spotify3DS. The app controls
the active device; it does not play audio through the console.

`creds.cfg` contains a plaintext bearer credential. Keep it private and revoke
access at <https://spotify.com/account/apps> if the SD card or file is lost.

## Controls

> **Global volume:** Press `L/R` on any screen to decrease/increase volume in
> 5% steps. Hold either button to keep changing it.

- Player: `A` play/pause, D-pad left/right previous/next, `L/R` volume down/up,
  `X` Library, and `Y` show/hide cover art. Tap a Recently Played tile to open its tracks; hold it
  for 600 ms to start the collection immediately. Tracks opened from this shelf
  return directly to Player with `B` or the top-left back control.
- Library: tap a row's play icon to start it immediately, or its right chevron
  to open its tracks. The current playing row shows pause in the same cell.
  D-pad up/down selects a collection, `A` starts it and then toggles play/pause,
  `X` opens its tracks,
  D-pad left/right skips the previous/next song, `SELECT` toggles play/pause,
  `L/R` changes volume, `ZL/ZR` jumps sections, and `B` returns. Tap `FIND` to filter saved albums and
  playlists by name, artist, or owner using the system keyboard; tap the filter
  strip's `X` to clear it.
- Tracks: tap a row's play icon to start it immediately; the current playing
  track shows pause in the same cell. D-pad up/down selects a song, `A` plays
  it and then toggles play/pause, `L/R` changes volume, `ZL/ZR` changes 50-track
  pages, D-pad left/right skips the previous/next song, `SELECT` toggles
  play/pause, `X` queues the selected song, and `B` returns to the Library. Tap a
  row's right queue icon to queue it directly. Moving past a page boundary with
  D-pad up/down also loads the adjacent page automatically. Playlist pagination
  wraps: `ZL`/Up on the first page opens the last page, and `ZR`/Down on the last
  page opens the first page. The play icon at the right of the header starts
  the whole album or playlist without leaving Tracks.

Volume changes step by five; hold either shoulder button to keep stepping. A
transient bottom-screen overlay shows the current level. Devices
that report no remote-volume support get an explanatory overlay instead of an
API command.
On original 3DS/2DS models without `ZL/ZR`, use touch or D-pad boundary paging;
Library sections remain reachable by scrolling.

Library and Tracks mark Spotify's current context or song with a green title,
edge, row tint, and an equalizer over its artwork. The bars animate while
playing and remain fixed while paused. The same equalizer marks the current
collection on the Player shelf, which is always pinned to the leftmost tile.

Only the current 50-track page is kept in RAM, so playlists with thousands of
songs use the same bounded memory as small playlists. Track ordering is always
fetched fresh from Spotify. Album-cover thumbnails use the content-addressed SD
artwork cache.

## Requirements

- Spotify **Premium** (the playback-control endpoints return 403 on free accounts)
- A homebrew-enabled 3DS, or the Azahar emulator
- For source builds: devkitARM + libctru, the portlibs listed below, `makerom`,
  and `bannertool`

## Why mbedTLS is bundled

The 3DS `sslc` system module maxes out at **TLS 1.1**, and Spotify requires
**TLS 1.2+**. So `httpc`/`sslc` cannot reach the API at all. Instead this app
links mbedTLS and speaks TLS in userspace over raw BSD sockets, bypassing
`sslc` entirely.

Both DigiCert roots must be embedded: **G2 (RSA)** serves `api.spotify.com` and
`accounts.spotify.com`, while **G3 (ECC)** serves the `i.scdn.co` album-art CDN.
Omitting G3 produces a confusing failure where the API works perfectly but
cover art silently never loads. Verified: the two hosts negotiate
`ECDHE-RSA-...` and `ECDHE-ECDSA-...` respectively, so the chains really are
independent.

### Entropy

The packaged mbedTLS is built with `MBEDTLS_NO_PLATFORM_ENTROPY` and
`MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_HARDWARE_ALT`, so its only built-in source is
`mbedtls_hardware_poll()` → `sslcGenerateRandomData()`. That means **`sslcInit()`
must be called** even though we do TLS ourselves — `sslc` is used purely as an
RNG here, and its TLS 1.1 ceiling is irrelevant to that.

`PS_GenerateRandomBytes` looks like the more natural choice but returns
`0xD8E007F7` (unavailable) under Azahar, so it is registered only as an
*optional* extra source with threshold 0. It must not report
`ENTROPY_SOURCE_FAILED` when absent, or it poisons the accumulator and seeding
fails even though the sslc source is healthy.

## Development setup

```sh
sudo dkp-pacman -S 3ds-zlib 3ds-mbedtls 3ds-libjpeg-turbo
./dev.sh          # build, run in Azahar, print pass/fail
./dev.sh --build  # build only
./dev.sh --log    # also dump the guest debug log
./tests/run_host_tests.sh  # deterministic cache-shard and HTTP framing tests
```

To test Spotify Connect volume control with the same credentials used by the
3DS, start playback on a Premium account and run:

```sh
python3 tools/set_volume.py 50
python3 tools/set_volume.py --get                    # query active volume
python3 tools/set_volume.py 50 --device-id <DEVICE_ID>  # optional target
```

The script refreshes OAuth, checks that the target supports volume control,
requires Spotify's `204 No Content` response, and verifies the reported volume.
If Spotify reports that it rotated the refresh token, re-copy the updated
`creds.cfg` to `SD:/spotify/creds.cfg` before launching Spotify3DS. Passing the
SD card's credential path with `--creds` updates it in place instead.

### Emulator auth

1. Create an app at <https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard>
2. Add this redirect URI **exactly**: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
3. Run the bootstrap with your Client ID:

```sh
python3 tools/bootstrap_auth.py --client-id <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>
```

It opens Spotify's own login page in your browser, catches the redirect on a
throwaway local listener, and writes `creds.cfg`. Copy that to the SD card as
`/spotify/creds.cfg` (for Azahar:
`~/Library/Application Support/Azahar/sdmc/spotify/creds.cfg`).

Spotify refresh tokens expire six months after authorization. When Spotify3DS
shows **Authorization expired**, rerun the bootstrap command and replace the
console's `creds.cfg` with the newly generated file.

PKCE means **no `client_secret` exists**, so no secret ever reaches the console
or the repo, and the script never sees your password. The 3DS thereafter only
performs `grant_type=refresh_token`.

> **Note:** that refresh token is a plaintext bearer credential on the SD card.
> Homebrew has no secure storage — any encryption key would have to sit beside
> the ciphertext. Revoke anytime at <https://spotify.com/account/apps>.

## Development notes

Verification is headless: the app writes machine-readable verdicts to
`sdmc:/testresult.txt`, which `dev.sh` reads back from the host. A missing
`DONE` sentinel means the app hung or crashed — distinct from a clean failure.

Environment quirks worth knowing, all learned the hard way:

- Launch Azahar via `open -a Azahar.app --args -w <file>.3dsx`. Invoking
  `Contents/MacOS/azahar` directly pops a modal and hangs forever.
- `svcOutputDebugString` / `LOG_DEBUG` is **compiled out** of Azahar release
  builds. It is not a usable debug channel; write to the SD card instead.
- The GDB stub **halts the guest at boot** waiting for a debugger. Keep
  `use_gdbstub=false` unless actively debugging.
- Azahar rewrites `qt-config.ini` on quit, so only edit config while it is
  fully stopped.
- `Failed to find title id for ROM` in the emulator log is normal for `.3dsx`.

Hold **SELECT** at boot to keep the app running instead of auto-exiting, which
is useful when capturing screenshots.
